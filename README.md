# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier (ResNet-50 + Streamlit)

A web-based image classification app that predicts the category of an uploaded image using a **fine-tuned ResNet-50 model** trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.

## Installation (Run Locally)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaSeiden/cifar10.git
cd cifar10

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Training & Weights

* The model was fine-tuned locally on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-50.
* Weights are stored in the `models/` folder under `cifar10_resnet50.pth`.
* The app automatically loads these weights at runtime for inference.

## Example Predictions (from demo)

| Input Image  | Prediction | Confidence |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| cat1.jpg     | cat        | 96.69%     |
| dog1.jpg     | dog        | 34.41%     |
